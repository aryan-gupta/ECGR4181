Problem 1

In this assignment, you will explore the effectiveness of branch direction prediction (taken vs not taken) on an actual program. Your task will be using the branch trace to evaluate the effectiveness of a few simple branch prediction schemes. To do this, you'll write a program that reads in the trace and simulates different branch prediction schemes and different predictor sizes. You can write the program in whatever language you like; although we are going to ask for a printout of your source code. The end result of this assignment are the experimental results (and the program source code).

The trace we're giving you is a trace of 16 million conditional branches. These are the conditional branches from an execution of the program GCC (Gnu C Compiler) from the SPECint2000 benchmark suite. As unconditional branches are always taken, they are excluded from the trace. Each line of the trace file has two fields. Below are the first four lines of a trace file:

3086629576 T

3086629604 T

3086629599 N

3086629604 T

The first field is the address of the branch instruction. The second field is the character "T" or "N" for branch taken or not taken. The trace is provided on Canvas under file directory.

A) Assume 1K (1024) entry for Pattern History Table (PHT) with 2-bit Counter per entry (predictor index size of 2 bits), implement and compare the mis-prediction of the following branch predictors:
One level branch Prediction
Two Level Global Branch Prediction
Two Level Gshare Branch Predictor
Two Level Local Branch Prediction (assume 128 entry for Local History Register Table)
You should able to come up with the bit-width of local and global history registers. Although initialization doesn't effect the results in any significant way, your code should initialize the predictor to "strongly not taken".

Plot the mis-prediction results across branch predictions and analyze the achieved results. Which one is the most efficient branch predictor (50 pts)? (Make sure to submit your code)

 

Problem 2

Repeat the Problem 1, this time with variable entry size (n-bit Counter) with size of 2 bits, 4 bits, 6 bits, 8 bits for Gshare and Two-Level Local Branch Predictors. Generate a dedicated line plot of the data using MS Excel for each branch predictor. On the y-axis, plot "percentage of branches miss-predicted". On the x-axis plot the predictor size (basically, the width of n-bit counter). Analyze the data and argue the effect of increasing counter bits on branch predictor performance. In your view how many bits seems sufficiently enough for branch predictor (50 pts)? (Make sure to submit your code)

 

Problem 3

 

Repeat problem 2, but this time on Dhrystone and Linpack benchmarks. Use the Pin tool to generate the branch trace. My PhD student already created a well-documented instruction for generating branch trace using Pin. Please see here:

Plot the results over variable entry size (n-bit Counter) with size of 2 bits, 4 bits, 6 bits, 8 bits for Gshare and Two-Level Local Branch Predictors, per each application. Analyze the results across both applications (50pts).

 

Problem 4: Extra credit: Branch Prediction Competition (50pts Extra Credit)

Implement a branch predictor that combine the benefits of Gshare and Two-Level Local Branch Predictor or even a new branch predictor that outperform Gshare and Two Level Local Branch Predictors. Plot your result and compare it with previous branch predictors (Gshare and Two Level Local Branch Predictors). Make sure to argue and analyze you achieved results. Also make sure to submit your code.

 

Note: Students achieve higher than 90% correct prediction for all three applications will receive complete 50pts extra credit! The Winner of competition will receive 50pts additional credit on quizzes.
